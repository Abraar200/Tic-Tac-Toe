# Tic-Tac-Toe
My first program made in java. Make sure to copy the codes and paste them on you own programming IDE. Then go to main method and print this to access it perfectly.
Program to enter in main method:

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ticTacToe tok = new ticTacToe();

        String tiktok = "toktik";

    }

}
